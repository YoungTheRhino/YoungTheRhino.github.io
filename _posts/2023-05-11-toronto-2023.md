### Intro:

As the NBA has evolved through the pace-and-space era, the most valued player characteristics shifted from sheer bruising size to speed and length. Throughout the 2010s, front offices sought out players with length and athleticism to complement their existing rosters. The present-day Orlando Magic and Oklahoma City Thunder strike out as teams who, facing long and extensive rebuilds, targeted lengthy athletes in their player acquisitions. The logic was to attain those with this 'ideal' physical profile, then use their tanking years to develop and imbue them with the necessary basketball skills to excel and take them to playoff success. However, the one team who arguably took this strategy the farthest was already coming off sustained playoff success: the Toronto Raptors.

The Raptors have been a perennial presence in the playoffs since the early 2010s, culminating in them winning the 2019 NBA title. The championship run was kickstarted by their trade acquisition of cyborg superstar Kawhi Leonard, the seemingly ideal 6'9 wing whose development seemed to inspire future player development strategy. From coming off the bench as a defensive specialist to acquiring the shooting and ball-handling to become a primary offensive option at San Antonio, Leonard became the zenith of two-way wings and ascended to the top of the NBA world during that 2019 championship run. No wonder then that even when Leonard left Toronto for warmer waters, the Raptors front office would continue to look for players that could eventually fit this archetype. And so began the organization's team-building strategy, colloquially known as Project 6'9.

- Incumbent members Pascal Siakam, O.G Anunoby, Chris Boucher
- Acquire Precious Achuiwa from Miami Heat
- Draft Scottie Barnes in 2021 with 4th overall pick
- Lack of true seven footers/size, established rim protectors
- Frenetic style of defense, stagnant offense in 2021 after Lowry's departure
- 2023 devolved even further, forcing the front office into a band-aid fix through the trade for Jakob Poetl
